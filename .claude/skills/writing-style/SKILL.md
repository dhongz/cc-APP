# Writing Style

Apply these conventions when creating or editing content for the knowledge base.

## Voice

- Write in second person when giving instructions ("Run the command", not "The user should run")
- Use active voice over passive
- Be direct — omit filler phrases like "It's important to note that" or "Please be aware"

## Structure

- Lead with the most important information
- Use headers to break up content longer than ~200 words
- Prefer bullet lists over prose for 3+ related items
- Use `code formatting` for file paths, commands, and technical terms

## Length

- Notes should be scannable in under 2 minutes
- If a section runs long, consider splitting into a separate document
- Summaries: 3–5 bullet points is usually enough

## Frontmatter

All notes should start with a blockquote summary:

```markdown
# Title

> One or two sentences describing what this document is and when to use it.
```

## Tone

Informative but not formal. Write like you're leaving a clear note for a future version of yourself.
